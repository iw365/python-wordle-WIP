# python wordle WIP
 wordle in the terminal using python

This is a very simple game of wordle made with python for a school project

It is still a work-in-progress project but it does the job

IMPORTANT:
- The AI is very bad and currently unfinished, it is very unlikely to get the word right
- The list of words I used is a very long list, containing many words that are very obscure, so it might be worth replacing the list with a better one
